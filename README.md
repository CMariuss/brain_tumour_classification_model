### Brain Tumour Classification Models with Tensorflow and MONAI

<p>The goal of this project was to train two AI models using neural networks from TensorFlow and MONAI in order to classify 3 types of brain tumour, as well as to compare the results obtained during the training process.</p>

<p>The model trained with MONAI neural networks for 20 epochs reached an accuracy of 99.49%, while the one trained with TensorFlow for the same number of epochs reached 99.71% accuracy.</p>
<p>Although there is not a big difference in the accuracy results, the time required to train the model with TensorFlow was incomparable smaller as we can see in the table above.</p>

<p>The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset</p>
